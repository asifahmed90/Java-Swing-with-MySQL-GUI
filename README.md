# Java-Swing-with-MySQL-GUI
Simple GUI application with Swing in the front end to show statistical analysis by retrieving data from MySQL. The steps are as follows:

i.	Initially the classes performed database access from a server and retrieve the data. A simple swing GUI has been created to display the table from the MySQL database. In other words, they can perform console based UI with database access or GUI UI with file access to data.

ii.	A class is created that holds the methods to perform numerous data and statistical analysis. The class needs instance variables for the data (input) as well as for the generated results (output). The analysis included the average (mean), variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range of values in the data array.

iii.	The result is connected with the front end swing GUI and will display the result for the first row when the calculate button is clicked.
